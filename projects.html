        <p style="margin-right: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
          Many students face the issue of needing multiple resources open at a time when selecting their courses. 
          I know I have now for a while, so I created ZotRequisites to help resolve it. 
          The webpage utilizes the PetrPortal API to collect course and professor information, and includes bootstrap for higher responsiveness. 
          With the help of these technologies, I was able to have the webpage display any prerequisite and additional information of any given course in UCI's directory. 
          The same applies for professor information such as overall GPA and times that they've recently taught a given class.

        <p style="margin-right: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
          Like many other Computer Science majors, I too tend to play League of Legends from time to time. 
          Because of this, I thought it would be fun to create my own Discord bot that retrieves and displays player information 
          that might give me an idea of what type of people I go up against in games. 
          I integrated with Riot's API to fetch real-time player statistics, match history, and champion data. 
          All of which were used to design commands include viewing player rankings, most played characters for a given player, 
          player stats for different game modes, in-game character information, and hopefully more to come in the future.

        <p style="margin-right: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
          Recent studies show that productivity, efficiency, and overall motivation increase whenever an activity is directly linked to a reward. 
          However, a lot of the time, people lack incentive when it comes to their own personal goals. 
          GoalPoints is a mobile app designed resolve this issue. 
          How? It fosters self-motivation through an incentivized goal tracking system. 
          The app enables users to set, track, and achieve personal goals, earning points upon completion which can be redeemed for self-set rewards. 
          The app is backend by Firebase and Firestore to ensure that all of this information is securely stored in real-time, 
          allowing for a seamless and reliable user experience. 
          This encourages a more productive environment and allows others to gain that push that they needed to become more productive in their life.
